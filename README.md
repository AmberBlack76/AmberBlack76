- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmberBlack76
- 👀 I’m interested in learning UI/UX design on a more serious level.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Github, and designing on Figma for an internship role I am currently working with. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to UI/UX once I get my feet wet in this platform. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...amberblackcreations@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love nature, so much that once spent 3 months in Northern Ontario treeplanting and lived in a tent. It snowed the first couple of weeks and I still have the blackfly bite scars to prove it.
